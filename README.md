Hello everyone!

I'm Loris, a 17 years old guy from Bergamo, in northern Italy :it: . I'm currently attending an ICT high school 🏫: - I.T.I.S "P.Paleocapa" - 
I love playing volley 🏐, listening to music 🎵 and playing the flute.

My ultimate goals in life are to be useful to others and learn as much as I can about the world, and up to now my greatest wish is to travel across the world🗺️: I hope I'll be able to fulfill this dream!
